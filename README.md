### Basic structure

This page is based on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
And using a custom domain. [(Custom URLs)](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/)  

### Setting up SSL

One disadvantage of using a custom domain is that your page will no longer work over HTTPS.  
This is because the GitHub servers only has a SSL certificate that covers *.github.io domains, not any of its subdomains.  
So, using [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Secure and fast github pages with CloudFlare.
